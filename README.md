  It has been argued that humans rapidly adapt their lexical and syntactic expectations to match the statistics of the current linguistic context. We provide further support to this claim by showing that the addition of a simple adaptation mechanism to a neural language model improves our predictions of human reading times compared to a non-adaptive model. We analyze the performance of the model on controlled materials from psycholinguistic experiments and show that it adapts not only to lexical items but also to abstract syntactic structures.

  Essentially shows that normed cloze probabilities provide insufficient frequency controls in psycholinguistic studies. Demonstrates how to combine cloze probabilities and corpus statistics to better predict behavioral data. This very simple approach is able to account for a number of previous subcategorization results.
